I use this document for keeping track of problems or other issues.
It's mainly intended for my own use, but I'm including it in the module distribution in case anyone else is interested.

**************
* TODO - NOW *
**************

Upgrade Dave-L.com to XOOPS 2.2.3 and chess 1.0.7.

Need French translation.
 - After new version of module released, ask (someone) to do translation.

Investigate whether additional table indices should be added, e.g. players' user IDs.  Review all existing queries.
Candidates for new indices:
 - chess_games (primary key = game_id)
	suspended (first 19 bytes?) - admin/index.php, list suspended or active games
	pgn_result - admin/index.php, list active games
	create_date+start_date+last_date - admin/index.php, list active games
	white_uid, black_uid, pgn_result, is_rated, create_date+start_date+last_date - blocks/blocks.php, list games
	is_rated, white_uid, black_uid, pgn_result - include/functions.inc.php, ratings calc
	white_uid, black_uid, pgn_result, is_rated, create_date+start_date+last_date - index.php, list games
	white_uid, black_uid, is_rated, create_date+start_date+last_date - player_stats.php, list games
 - chess_challenges (primary key = challenge_id)
	create_date - admin/index.php, list challenges
	game_type, create_date - blocks.php, list challenges
	game_type, create_date - index.php, list challenges
	player1_uid, player2_uid, is_rated, create_date - player_stats, list challenges
 - chess_ratings (primary key = player_id)
	games_won+games_lost+games_drawn, rating - blocks/blocks.php, list players
	rating - player_stats.php, display player stats

Investigate possible bug in 1.0.6 french translation: popup window to confirm draw fails to appear.
 - Reference: <http://dev.xoops.org/modules/xfmod/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1690&forum_id=299>

Check for temporary #*#DEBUG# or #*#TBD# code before releasing.

Feature requests summary
 - time control
 - move replay (2)
 - conditional moves
 - function to delete completed games <<< NEED THIS
 - archive completed games

Color of player names in th-tag not visible enough in some themes, e.g. default theme, since they're now in a-tags.
 - relevant template is modules/chess/templates/chess_game_main.html

Rating system
 - allow initial rating to be player-specific?

Add a new table chess_players
 - for player confirm-move preferences, now stored in chess_games table

Consider adding an "opening library" of setup positions. Reference: http://chess.about.com/library/openings/bloc6000.htm

Check for calls to xoops_gethandler() that might be removed by using $xoopsModule or $xoopsModuleConfig, or might be avoided entirely if current module is not 'chess'.
 - fixed in xoops_version.php, still need to check other files

Add search function?

Add user-friendlier way to specify setup position when creating a new game?

Tournaments?

Index page (lists of challenges and games)
 - be able to sort by different columns? (Created, Started, Last move, etc.)

Rework game page
 - display opponent's last move

Finish cleaning up chessgame.inc.php

Make derived class from class ChessGame, to be used by game.php.
 - additional functionality, such as draw-offer and resign
 - or maybe add more to class ChessGame

Look into detecting stalemate when pieces other than the king have no legal moves (because the moves would place the king in check).

Check for inconsistencies in initial FEN setup:
 - impossible piece placements: e.g., more than 1 king or 8 pawns, pawns on unreachable tiles, other?

********
* TEST *

Do more testing of move-handling, including stalemate.

Need update script for database changes.

Got rid of class/smarty/plugins/modifier.xoops_format_date.php and include/phpdate.js, at least temporarily.
Changed files: 
  templates/chess_player_stats.html
  templates/chess_games.html
  templates/chess_game_main.html
  templates/chess_game_arbitrateform.html
  templates/blocks/chess_block_games.html
  templates/blocks/chess_block_challenges.html
The quick and dirty method was to change:
 <{TIMESTAMP|xoops_format_date:FORMAT}>
to:
<{FORMAT|date:TIMESTAMP}>

Change rating_system value for 'None' (no rating system) from '0' to 'none', to avoid type-ambiguity issues.

Feature requests summary
 - separate display of completed games from in-progess games
 - rating system (3)
 - separate display of "my games" from other games

Incompatibility with PHP5. include/chess.inc.php assigns error string to $this.
 - Workaround: use "$this->Object =" instead of "$this =".
 - Alternative solution: add property or method so that caller can check for ctor error.
 - Fixed by adding property "error".

Allow player to delete game, if applicable.
 - implemented

If a move is made as part of a draw-claim, and the move is valid but the draw-claim isn't valid, the move doesn't get stored in the database.  The functions that check draw-claims need to return the move-result and the draw-claim-result separately.
 - fixed

Message stating that game was drawn due to claim is not displayed, since that message is stored in $move_result, and that string is displayed as part of the move-form, which is not displayed if game is over.
 - fixed

Add tokens to forms.
 - Use conditonal check that the XOOPS version supports them.

Change inline documentation to comply with standard (phpdoc.org).
Example 1:
cd /opt/lampp/htdocs/xoops/modules/chess
/opt/lampp/bin/phpdoc -d ./ -t /opt/lampp/htdocs/phpdoc/chess

On List Games page, add menus for selecting games-in-play-only/concluded-games/both and rated-games-only/rated-and-unrated-games. (same as recent-games block options)
On List Games page, add menus for selecting open-challenges/individual-challenges/both. (same as recent-challenges block options)

On My Games page, add challenges. Include challenges offered by selected user and individual challenges offered to selected user.

Rating system
 - modular: ratings will be computed by a separate function that's easily modified.  
 - ratings will be cached in a new table chess_players (player_id, rating_current, rating_initial)
 - cached ratings will be recomputed for the two participants in a game when the game concludes, or for all players using a new admin function.
 - new preference items:
		rating_system: (select) rating system to use, includes choice "none" to disable ratings
		provisional_games: (int) number of rated games that must be played before the normal rating system is used
		initial_rating_default: (int)
		unrated_game_player_choice: (yes/no) whether a challenger may create an unrated game
 - when creating a challenge, the challenger may specify whether the game will be rated
 - add columns chess_challenges.is_rated and chess_games.is_rated - enum('1','0')
 - add display of all players' ratings (on main chess page and in new block)
 - add block: Highest rated players
 - need number of provisional games to be returned by the rating system (If a player has played fewer than this number of rated games, a different algorithm may be used to calculate the rating, and the rating will be indicated as provisional.)
 - split off chess_ratings_adj_* functions into separate file/class
 - add rating info to help file
 - optimize chess_rating_adj so that it can be used for a sequence of games without having to do separate queries for each game; maybe the input could be a condition, such as "game_id='n'", or '1', instead of $gid.
   - decided it was too complicated to handle both cases within one function, so added another function for calculating all ratings.
 - rename "chess_players" table back to "chess_ratings"?
 - on player stats page, add link to player's profile

Change column chess_games.pgn_result from varchar(7) to enum('*','0-1','1-0','1/2-1/2') default '*'.

Rename distribution file using Xoops standard naming convention, e.g.
XOOPS2_mod_chess_1.0.5_dave_l.zip

Displayed info for suspended games, on admin page and in arbiter controls on game page
 - map internal suspension type to user-friendly text (using language strings), want_arbitration >> "Arbitration requested", arbiter_suspend >> "Suspended by arbiter"
 - in arbiter controls, display suspension info in separate labelled fields, like on admin page.

Index page (lists of challenges and games)
 - need to paginate, to limit number of items listed.
 - by default, sort by date of last activity
 - also needed for admin pages that list games and challenges

Possible bug:
http://localhost/xoops/beta/modules/chess/game.php?game_id=23
Select Claim draw (threefold repetition) and Submit.
Error [Xoops]: Failed to perform move 0-0: ERROR: You cannot castle. in file C:\document\BigApache\htdocs\xoops\beta\modules\chess\game.php line 595
 - Not a bug. The game had an illegal move, possible since the game was stored while the move-engine was still being debugged.

Disable caching for help page, or use Smarty include-function to handle dynamic part (dependence on module options or admin-view).
 - disabled caching

Rename "pending games" to "challenges".

Finish FEN startup option
 - check for validity
 - use in initializing game

Javascript click-to-move does not recognize en passant capure
 - the "-" needs to be manually changed to "x" in the move textbox
 - should be possible for the Javascript to do a special check for a diagnonal pawn move to an empty square (possibly only the current en passant target square, if any), and replace the "-" with an "x"

Add Javascript popup window for pawn-promotion.
 - also verify that pawn promotion is handled correctly in handleMove()

Update help file.

Automatically detect certain forced-draw conditions.
 - K vs.K, K vs. K+N, K vs. K+B

Finish admin functions

Check for inconsistencies in initial FEN setup:
 - if castling availability is indicated, then the appropriate king and rook must be on the proper tiles
 - if an en passant target square is indicated, then there must be a pawn of the appropriate color on the proper tile
 - if an en passant target square is indicated, then the appropriate color must be active

Handle some draw-claims automatically.
 - 50-move-rule
 - threefold-repetition rule
 - *** a draw-claim can only be made by a player who has the move

Rework game page
 - use standard Xoops CSS (and form class?)
 - elements "jump around" when page is refreshed
   - use fixed-size tables?
 - is page too complicated?
 - move PGN/FEN display to separate page?

Caching - either figure out how to cache pages appropriate to current options (is-player, has-move, etc.), or figure out how to prevent caching.
 - Disabled module-wide caching in create.php and game.php.
 - Caching is ok in index.php, since the content is not user-dependent.

Implement block(s):
 - open challenges (option: max # to display)
 - active games (started) (option: max # to display)

Allow player to delete pending game.
