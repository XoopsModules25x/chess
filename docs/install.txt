Adding a new rating system
--------------------------

1) Choose an internal name and a display name for the rating system.  The internal name should contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and '_'.

The following steps use an example in which the internal name is "fbar" and the display name is "Foobar System".
The internal name is translated to all-uppercase "FBAR" when used in names of constants.

2) Create a new file include/ratings_fbar.inc.php, with functions chess_ratings_adj_fbar and chess_ratings_num_provisional_games_fbar. The function chess_ratings_adj_fbar updates the players' ratings for a specified game ID, and the function chess_ratings_num_provisional_games_fbar returns the number of provisional games for the rating system.  Use the existing file include/ratings_cxr.php or include/ratings_linear.php as an example.

3) Add a language constant in language/-/modinfo.php: define('_MI_CHESS_RATING_SYSTEM_FBAR', 'Foobar System');

4) Modify the language constant _MI_CHESS_RATING_SYSTEM_DES in language/-/modinfo.php to include a brief description of the rating system.

5) If applicable, modify the language constant _MI_CHESS_INITIAL_RATING_DES in language/*/modinfo.php.

6) Add a language constant _HE_CHESS_RATINGS_FBAR in language/-/help.php that provides a brief description of the rating system.

7) Add an option to $modversion['config'][5]['options'] in xoops_version.php: _MI_CHESS_RATING_SYSTEM_FBAR => 'fbar'

8) Update the chess module from the XOOPS modules administration page.

9) If you want to use the new rating system as the current rating system, use the XOOPS Chess module preferences page to select the new rating system, and use Main Menu >> Chess >> Player Ratings >> Recalculate all player ratings >> Submit to recalulate the existing ratings using the new rating system.
